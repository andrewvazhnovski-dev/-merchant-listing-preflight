            Merchant Listing Preflight provides diagnostic reports and
            preparation checklists for Google Merchant Center and merchant
            listing issues. The service is designed to help identify likely
            technical, feed, landing page and structured data problems before a
            merchant requests another review.

              A diagnostic report is based on the information available at the
              time of review. Product data, website content, structured data,
              prices, availability and platform policies may change after the
              report is delivered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of this, findings should be treated as preparation
              guidance, not as a permanent guarantee.
